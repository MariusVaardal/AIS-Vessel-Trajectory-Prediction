    "AIS is a short range tracking system that transmits ships positions using the high frequency maritime frequency band. It was originally developed as a collision avoidance tool. Each ship transmits a signal containing vessel identity, position, speed and course to surrounding ships and shore stations. The position of the ship is obtained by either using the ships GPS signal or an inertial sensor built into the AIS unit. Static information is sent every sixth minute or at request the ship sends MMSI number, IMO number, name and call sign, length and beam, type of ship and location of position fixing antenna. Dynamic information is sent dependent on the speed and course alterations of the ship. The dynamic information consist of Ships position, accuracy indication, position timestamp and the course over ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is mandatory for all ships above 300 GT (gross tonnage) to carry AIS, and it is illegal to turn it of. All 300 GT boats mus carry a class A AIS system, while other boats like pleasure crafts can carry a class B AIS system with limited functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "The signals are sensible to noise and enviromental disturbances. Making AIS unpredictable. Some relevant factors are signal propagation conditions, sea state, the height of antennas and strength of the transmitter. These factors giva a large variation in signal transmition length from 20-350 nautical miles. But an average of 40 nautical miles can safely be expected."
