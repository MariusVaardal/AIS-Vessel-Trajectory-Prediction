Ideas:
- Normalize
- Could change day_of_week to is_weekend
- Should fix so that we predict 5 days into the future and not just one
- Could merge all the "prev course" features into a single estimated value of the current position 
- Should look at data and try to find some garbage to drop. Outliers, for example. 
- Should parse ETARAW to datetime format
	- Can use this feature to get a new feature, "hurry_factor" or something
- PortID can be wrong and miseleading in some cases, should be careful with this feature. 
	- Read what is written about this feature
	- It's used as a proposal to identify the destination or origin port of a vesselâ€™s voyage. 
- ROT Should be preprocessed. I dont understand the explanation.
- Could use portID to figure out the location of the destination and add this as a feature
